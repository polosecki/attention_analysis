correct_old_mat_files: parses again log files. Necessary for analyzing old sessions.
entropy_and_corr_calculation: makes the plot of entropy and correlation between distractor and cued RTs.
errorbar: auxiliary function
get_behavioral_data:Given a monkey, area and cell_no, it ...
make_behavior_for_monkey_and_area:for each session, computes the significance of detection and discrimination. Calls compute_discrimination_detection_behav
make_winrich_figure: makes plot of joint distribution of RT relative to distractor and cued surface for each monkey
plot_2d_distribution_with_marginals: called by make_winrich_figure
plot_BRT_distributions: makes basic plots of BRT and RTs for both monkeys.
plot_RT_distributions: makes plost of RTs conditioned on different BRt times.
plot_joint_distributions: makes 2d histograms of RTs nd BRTs.
compute_discrimination_detection_behav: computer PERFORMANCE METRICS and SIGNIFICANCE
consistency_metric_from_raw_data: Function that takes data from a session and compute %success separated by consistency with targer and/or distractor surface, and stats too!
